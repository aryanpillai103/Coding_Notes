## A. Brute Force Approach


```cpp
void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;  // edge case when only one element is present in                                    array
    sort(arr,arr+n);//sort the array using sort function
    int small=arr[1];//take second smallest as second element in the array
    int large=arr[n-2]; //take second largest as second last element
    cout<<"Second smallest is "<<small<<endl; // return them
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<large<<endl;
}
```

Time complxity :- O(nlogn) <br>
space complexity :- O(1)

## Better Solution


```c++

void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)//edge case : if an array has 0 or 1 element
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;
    int small=INT_MAX,second_small=INT_MAX;//declare small, second large = INT_MAX
    int large=INT_MIN,second_large=INT_MIN;//declare large , second_large = INT_MIN
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        small=min(small,arr[i]);//if current element is small replace it with      previous small
        large=max(large,arr[i]);//if current element is large replce it with       previous large
    }
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {//imp step: if current element is less than second small and current element is not equal to small
        if(arr[i]<second_small && arr[i]!=small)
            second_small=arr[i];
    //imp step: if current element is larger than second large and current element is not equal to large
        if(arr[i]>second_large && arr[i]!=large)
            second_large=arr[i];
    }

    cout<<"Second smallest is "<<second_small<<endl;//return the answers
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<second_large<<endl;
}

```

**Time Complexity:** O(N) (reason being we are using two traversals) <br>
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (we are not using any extra space)


## C. Optimal Solution

```c++
class Solution {
    private:
    //function to calculate second largest element in the array optimal solution
    int secondLargest(vector<int>& arr){
    
        int n = arr.size();//declare n as array size
        int large = -1;// declare large as -1
        int second_large = -1;//declare second large = -1
        int i;
        
        for(i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){ // iterate from 1 to n 
            if(arr[i] > large){ // if current element is greater than large
                second_large = large;//replace second large with large 
                large = arr[i];// replace large with current array element
            }
            //if current element is greater than second large and current element 
//is not large
            else if(arr[i] > second_large && arr[i]!= large){
                second_large = arr[i];
            }
        }
        //return second largest
        return second_large;
    }
  public:
    int getSecondLargest(vector<int> &arr) {
        int ans = secondLargest(arr);//function call
        return ans;//return answer
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N) (it is a single pass solution)<br>
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (we are not using any extra space)
