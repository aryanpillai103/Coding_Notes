## A. Brute Force Approach


```cpp
void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;  // edge case when only one element is present in                                    array
    sort(arr,arr+n);//sort the array using sort function
    int small=arr[1];//take second smallest as second element in the array
    int large=arr[n-2]; //take second largest as second last element
    cout<<"Second smallest is "<<small<<endl; // return them
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<large<<endl;
}
```

Time complxity :- O(nlogn)
space complexity :- O(1)

```c++

void getElements(int arr[],int n)
{
    if(n==0 || n==1)//edge case : if an array has 0 or 1 element
        cout<<-1<<" "<<-1<<endl;
    int small=INT_MAX,second_small=INT_MAX;//declare small, second large = INT_MAX
    int large=INT_MIN,second_large=INT_MIN;//declare large , second_large = INT_MIN
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        small=min(small,arr[i]);//if current element is small replace it with      previous small
        large=max(large,arr[i]);//if current element is large replce it with       previous large
    }
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {//imp step: if current element is less than second small and current element is not equal to small
        if(arr[i]<second_small && arr[i]!=small)
            second_small=arr[i];
    //imp step: if current element is larger than second large and current element is not equal to large
        if(arr[i]>second_large && arr[i]!=large)
            second_large=arr[i];
    }

    cout<<"Second smallest is "<<second_small<<endl;//return the answers
    cout<<"Second largest is "<<second_large<<endl;
}

```

Time Complexity: O(N) (reason being we are using two traversals)

Space Complexity: O(1) (we are not using any extra space)
